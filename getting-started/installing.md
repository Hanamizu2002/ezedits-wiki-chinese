# Installing

ezEdits is installed like any other plugin, but requires either WorldEdit or FastAsyncWorldEdit to already be installed (only one, not both).

* [WorldEdit](https://modrinth.com/plugin/worldedit)
* [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/)

You can obtain the .jar file by supporting us on Patreon/Ko-Fi (currently unreleased).

Simply drop the .jar file into your plugins folder and run your server as normal. An "ezEdits" folder containing a config.yml file will be created which you can edit.&#x20;
